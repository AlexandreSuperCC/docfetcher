# In this configuration file you can customize the paths where DocFetcher will
# look for its settings and index files. These settings apply only to the
# *portable* version of DocFetcher; in the non-portable version they are
# ignored.
# 
# This file follows the conventions of the Java Properties format. In
# particular, the following rules apply:
# * Lines starting with '#' are considered comments and will be ignored. Remove
#   the '#' characters in front of the "key=value" lines below to enable the
#   respective settings.
# * Backslashes must be escaped, i.e. whenever you want to write down a '\'
#   character, insert '\\' instead.
# * Other characters to be escaped with a backslash include ' and ". Thus, you
#   have to enter \' and \" instead.
# * You can use forward slashes instead of backslashes in file paths, even on
#   Windows. Forward slashes don't need to be escaped.
# * The expected encoding is ISO-8859-1, aka Latin-1. All non-Latin-1 characters
#   must be entered as Unicode escapes, e.g. '\u00F6' instead of 'รถ'.
# 
# You can specify relative paths with ".." (two dots), which means "go up one
# level in the folder hierarchy". Relative paths are relative to the DocFetcher
# folder, not to this file. Example: ..\\some\\folder
# 
# DocFetcher recognizes the special variable ${user.home}, which points to the
# current user's home directory. Accordingly, ${user.home}/.docfetcher would be
# a folder named '.docfetcher' under the home directory.
# 
# For more information on the Properties format, see:
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties

# Where the settings are stored:
#settings=C:\\path\\to\\settings\\folder

# Where the indexes are stored. Note: The DocFetcher daemon currently ignores
# this setting. Also, you cannot reuse indexes created with the *non-portable*
# version of DocFetcher.
#indexes=C:\\path\\to\\indexes\\folder

# Where the SWT library files will be written to:
#swt=C:\\path\\to\\swt-libs
