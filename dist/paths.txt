# This configuration file allows you to customize the paths where DocFetcher
# will look for its settings and index files. Lines starting with '#' are
# ignored. Remove the '#' characters in front of the "key=value" lines to enable
# them.
# You can specify relative paths with ".." (two dots), which means "go up one
# level in the folder hierarchy". Relative paths are relative to the DocFetcher
# folder, not to this file.
# Backslashes must be escaped, i.e. whenever you want to write down a '\'
# character, insert '\\' instead.

# Where the settings are stored:
#settings=C:\\path\\to\\settings\\folder

# Where the indexes are stored:
#indexes=C:\\path\\to\\indexes\\folder
