			<h1>How to raise the memory limit</h1><p>DocFetcher has a default memory limit of 256 MB, which is set on startup. The limit can be raised by fiddling with the platform-specific launchers:</p><h2>Windows</h2><p>The Windows version of DocFetcher ships with ready-made alternative launchers that set different heap sizes. For example, the launcher <code>misc\DocFetcher-512.exe</code> will set a heap size of 512 MB. You can find these launchers in the <code>misc</code> folder inside the DocFetcher folder. If you're using the non-portable version of DocFetcher, the DocFetcher folder will be in <code>C:\Program Files\</code> or a similar location.</p><p>Before you can use one of the alternative launchers, you'll have to copy it from the <code>misc</code> folder into the DocFetcher folder. It's not necessary to delete the default launcher or to rename the alternative launcher.</p><p>Another way of changing the memory limit is to copy the file <code>misc\DocFetcher.bat</code> into the DocFetcher folder and alter the expression <code>-Xmx256m</code> in the last line of the file, for example to <code>-Xmx512m</code>.</p><h2>Linux</h2><p>The Linux launcher script will be in <code>/usr/share/docfetcher/</code> if you're using the non-portable version of DocFetcher. Open the launcher script <code>DocFetcher.sh</code> with a text editor, and in the last line, alter the expression <code>-Xmx256m</code> as needed, for example to <code>-Xmx512m</code>.</p><h2>Mac OS X</h2><p>Both in the non-portable and the portable version, DocFetcher is launched via an application bundle. In the non-portable version, the application bundle is just what you got out of the downloaded disk image. In the portable version, the application bundle can be found in the DocFetcher folder.</p><p>In both cases, the application bundle is actually a folder with the extension <code>.app</code>. There should be a context menu entry in Finder to open this folder. If your Mac OS X language is English, this menu entry will be named <code>Show Package Contents</code>.</p><p>Inside the folder, you will find this launcher script: <code>Contents/MacOS/DocFetcher</code>. Open it with a text editor, and in the last line, alter the expression <code>-Xmx256m</code> as needed, for example to <code>-Xmx512m</code>.</p>
